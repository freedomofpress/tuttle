This project—codenamed `tuttle`—allows a server to receive Signal messages and provides an administrative interface over a Tor Onion Service for users to read and reply to those messages. It is currently in active development and should only be used with great care.

As currently envisioned, `tuttle` could be used as a "tipline" or "help desk," where one or more users can process and reply to secure messages and attachments sent to a public Signal number.

Authentication is not currently built in to `tuttle`, meaning access control is currently performed through `tor`. For now, that involves a trade-off: older `v2` style Onion addresses can be configured to use HidServAuth for authentication, which is not yet available in newer `v3` addresses; but `v3` addresses have more protection against being enumerated by malicious nodes.

### How it works

`tuttle` depends on `signal-cli` to send and receive Signal messages. Messages are logged to an internal database using `logincoming.py`, running as a background process. `app.py` is run with `flask` to serve on a localhost port the dynamic interface generated by `readlog.py`. Finally, an externally configured Onion service makes that interface available to users.
